# To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do List web application that allows users to create, manage, and save their tasks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application utilizes the browser's local storage to store the to-do items, ensuring that the data persists even after the page is refreshed or closed.

## Getting Started

To use the To-Do List application, follow the instructions below:

1. Download the source code files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `utility.css` and `script.js`).
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Features

The To-Do List application provides the following features:

- Add new tasks: Users can enter a task in the input field and press the Enter key or click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Users can mark a task as completed by clicking on the checkbox prior to it. A line will be added through the task to indicate its completion.
- Remove tasks: Users can remove a task from the list by clicking on the "cross" icon next to it.
